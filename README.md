# BrewHood

#### A site to share and taste it your passion for homebrew beers.

This app was built with the main goal of learn,  understand and practice Ruby on Rails.


## Hosted by: <https://young-crag-54781.herokuapp.com>

* Navigate to app folder
* run brew install redis
* run bundle install
* run rails db: migrate
* run rails server
* Type localhost:3000 on your browser
* Read to go!

### Planing Experience

## Some Problems:

It is so hard to find people to give me an honest/professional feedback on my homebrew beer quality. (my mother opinion it's not so realistic ;) )

Find homebrewers that have the same brew level of skills that I have.

## What this app is for?

* Find and share homebrew beers.
* Support the homebrewer community.
* Share beers you are creating.
* Taste unique Beers.
* Know people who are passionate about beer.

## Some users stories:

  * In order to taste homebrew beer, as the one I am making, as a Homebrewer, I want to buy beers from people who produce beer for love and not for making money.

  * In order to compare the beer I am making with others at the same skill level I am in homebrewing, as a beer lover (and a homebrewer), I want to see for how long that producer is homebrewing.

  * In order to network with other homebrewers, as I homebrewer, I want to see contacts and information about them.
